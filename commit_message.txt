Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(docs): Add README Overview and Problem sections

Add Overview and Problem sections to README.

Added documentation:
- Overview: Project purpose and comparative modeling approach
- Problem: Describes the 3D structure prediction challenge
- Approach: High-level methodology using MODELLER

These sections provide context for users to understand what the project does
and why homology modeling is useful.

Verified: README has clear overview and problem statement.
