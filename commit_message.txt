Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | feat(modeling): Complete hydrogen modeling implementation

Complete build_model_with_hydrogens.py with hydrogen atom support.

Full implementation includes:
- env.io.hydrogen = True to enable explicit hydrogen modeling
- Complete modeling workflow identical to build_model.py
- Output includes all hydrogen atoms

This variant generates models with explicit hydrogen atoms, which are typically
not present in X-ray crystal structures but are important for certain analyses.

Verified: build_model_with_hydrogens.py complete with hydrogen support.
