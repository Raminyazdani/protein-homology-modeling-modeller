Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(modeling): Add MODELLER environment setup

Add MODELLER environment initialization to build_model.py.

Extended implementation includes:
- Environ object creation
- Environment configuration for MODELLER
- Basic main() implementation with environment setup

The MODELLER environment must be configured before any modeling operations.
This sets up the MODELLER library with appropriate parameters.

Verified: build_model.py includes MODELLER environment initialization.
