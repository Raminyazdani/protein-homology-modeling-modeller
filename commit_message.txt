Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | feat(config): Complete .gitignore with alignment and log exclusions

Complete .gitignore configuration with alignment file and log exclusions.

Final additions include:
- Alignment files (*.pir, *.ali, *.pap) - generated during sequence alignment
- Log files (*.log) - MODELLER and Python logging output
- Jupyter notebook checkpoints (.ipynb_checkpoints/)

The .gitignore is now complete and ready for development.

Verified: .gitignore contains all necessary exclusion patterns for the project.
