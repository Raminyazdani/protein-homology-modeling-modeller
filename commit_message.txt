Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(docs): Add README Data/Inputs section

Add Data/Inputs section to README.

Documented:
- Input file descriptions (target_sequence.fasta, template.pdb)
- Data source information (UniProt, GenBank, PDB)
- Data location (included in project)
- File format specifications

This section explains where the input data comes from and how users can
obtain or provide their own data files.

Verified: README documents input data requirements.
