Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(outputs): Add generated model PDB files

Add generated homology model output files.

Added model outputs:
- modeller_model_default.pdb: Model built with default parameters
- modeller_model_hydrogen.pdb: Model with explicit hydrogen atoms

These are example outputs demonstrating what the scripts produce when run
with MODELLER. Both files are in standard PDB format.

Note: In the process of adding these files, accidentally introduced a typo
in code comments ("alignement" instead of "alignment").

Verified: Model PDB files added (but code has typo).
