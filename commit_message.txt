Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(modeling): Create build_model_with_hydrogens.py skeleton

Create build_model_with_hydrogens.py with basic structure.

Initial implementation similar to build_model.py but will include explicit
hydrogen atoms in the model. This is useful for:
- Hydrogen bond analysis
- Electrostatic calculations
- Detailed structural analysis

The skeleton includes imports and basic structure setup.

Verified: build_model_with_hydrogens.py created with proper structure.
