Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | feat(modeling): Complete build_model.py implementation

Complete build_model.py with full automodel functionality.

Final implementation includes:
- Target sequence addition to alignment
- AutoModel configuration with template and target
- Model building and optimization
- Output PDB file generation

The script can now generate homology models from sequence and template inputs.
The automodel class handles model building, energy minimization, and structure
optimization automatically.

Verified: build_model.py is complete and ready for model generation.
