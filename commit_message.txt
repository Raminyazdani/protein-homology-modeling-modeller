Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | feat(data): Add template PDB structure

Add template protein structure in PDB format.

The template.pdb file contains the 3D coordinates of a known protein structure
that will serve as the template for homology modeling. The template should have
significant sequence similarity to the target sequence.

PDB format contains:
- Atomic coordinates (ATOM/HETATM records)
- Secondary structure information
- Experimental metadata

With both target sequence and template structure, we can now implement the
homology modeling workflow.

Verified: template.pdb added with valid PDB structure format.
