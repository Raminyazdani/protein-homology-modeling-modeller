Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(config): Add IDE and OS exclusions to .gitignore

Extend .gitignore with IDE and operating system file exclusions.

Added patterns for:
- IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/, *.swp, *.swo)
- OS files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- Editor backup files (*~)

These additions prevent IDE-specific and OS-specific artifacts from being committed.

Verified: .gitignore extended with IDE/OS patterns.
