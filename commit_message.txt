Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(modeling): Create build_model.py skeleton

Create build_model.py with basic structure and imports.

Initial implementation includes:
- MODELLER imports (modeller, automodel)
- OS and sys imports for path handling
- Script directory detection using __file__
- Empty main() function structure

This establishes the script architecture before adding complex modeling logic.

Verified: build_model.py created with proper imports and structure.
