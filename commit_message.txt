Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(docs): Add README Setup section

Add Setup/Installation section to README.

Added documentation for:
- Python dependency installation
- MODELLER installation and license setup
- Optional PyMOL installation

Note: Accidentally wrote "biotools" instead of "biopython" in the pip install
command. This will be fixed in the next commit.

Verified: Setup instructions added (but dependency name is wrong).
