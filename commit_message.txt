Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | fix(docs): Correct dependency name in setup instructions

Fix incorrect dependency name in README setup instructions.

Corrected "biotools" → "biopython" in pip install command.

The package name is "biopython" not "biotools". This error was introduced
in the previous commit and spotted immediately during review.

Verified: Correct package name now in setup instructions.
