Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | fix(metadata): Align project_identity keywords with README

Fix keyword inconsistencies between project_identity.md and README.

Updated project_identity.md keywords to match README content:
- Ensured all README topics are in project_identity
- Removed keywords not supported by README content
- Maintained consistency across both documents

Keywords now accurately reflect the project content and are consistent across
all documentation. This improves discoverability and professional presentation.

Verified: Keywords are now consistent across all documentation.
