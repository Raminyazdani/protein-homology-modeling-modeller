Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(config): Add MODELLER file exclusions

Extend .gitignore with MODELLER-specific intermediate file exclusions.

MODELLER generates many intermediate files during homology modeling runs:
- Model files (*.V*, *.D*)
- Configuration files (*.ini, *.lck)
- Restraint files (*.rsr, *.sch)

These files should not be version controlled as they are generated outputs.
Adding these exclusions before implementing MODELLER scripts.

Verified: .gitignore includes MODELLER intermediate file patterns.
