Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | fix(modeling): Correct typo in code comments

Fix typo in code comments found in previous commit.

Corrected "alignement" → "alignment" in code comments in build_model.py.

This typo was accidentally introduced when adding the model output files.
Spotted immediately during code review and corrected.

Verified: Spelling error fixed in comments.
