Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(docs): Add README Reproducibility section

Add Reproducibility Notes section to README.

Documented reproducibility considerations:
- MODELLER version effects on exact coordinates
- Random seed configuration for reproducibility
- Relative path usage
- PDB format version (v3.3)
- Swiss-Model result source

These notes help users understand factors that may affect exact reproducibility
and how to control them.

Verified: README includes reproducibility guidance.
