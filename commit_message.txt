Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(modeling): Add alignment object creation

Add alignment object creation to build_model.py.

Extended implementation includes:
- Alignment object instantiation from MODELLER environment
- Alignment configuration for sequence-structure alignment

The alignment is the foundation for homology modeling - it establishes the
correspondence between target sequence and template structure coordinates.

Verified: build_model.py creates alignment object correctly.
