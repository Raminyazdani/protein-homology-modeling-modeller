Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | feat(comparison): Add Swiss-Model prediction

Add Swiss-Model prediction for multi-method comparison.

Added swiss_model.pdb:
- Alternative homology model from Swiss-Model web server
- Enables comparison between MODELLER and Swiss-Model approaches
- Useful for validating modeling results

Swiss-Model is a widely-used alternative to MODELLER for homology modeling.
Including this comparison demonstrates consideration of multiple methodologies.

Verified: swiss_model.pdb added for comparative analysis.
