Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(verification): Verify project_identity alignment

Review and verify project_identity.md for accuracy.

Verification checklist:
- ✓ Display title matches README
- ✓ Tagline is accurate and compelling
- ✓ Tech stack matches actual usage
- ✓ Problem statement aligns with README
- ✗ ISSUE: Some keywords don't match between project_identity and README topics

Found mismatch in keywords - project_identity.md includes some keywords not
reflected in README, and vice versa. This needs to be fixed for consistency.

Verified: Metadata mostly aligned (but keywords need fixing).
