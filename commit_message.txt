Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(docs): Add README Tech Stack section

Add Tech Stack section to README.

Documented technologies:
- Python 3.x (core scripting language)
- BioPython (sequence and structure analysis)
- MODELLER (homology modeling engine)
- PyMOL (optional visualization)

Each technology is described with its role in the project. This helps users
understand the dependencies and what each component does.

Verified: README documents complete technology stack.
