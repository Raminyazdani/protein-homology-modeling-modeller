Ramin Yazdani | Protein Homology Modeling | main | WIP(modeling): Add template structure loading

Add template structure loading code to build_model.py.

Implementation now includes:
- Template model addition to alignment
- Model sequence extraction from PDB structure
- Alignment preparation for target sequence addition

The template structure is loaded and its sequence is extracted, preparing the
alignment for the target sequence. This establishes the template side of the
sequence-structure correspondence.

Verified: build_model.py loads template structure into alignment.
